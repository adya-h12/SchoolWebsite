        <p class="p_modal"> Shane van Neerden, Cab Class of 2018 - Since leaving the U.S. in 2018, Shane van Neerden has been developing his classical music performance career with incredible success. When he first began his studies in the Netherlands, he won first prize in a concerto competition as a first-year bachelor student, against three masters students, and consequently played Franz Liszt’s Totentanz with the Conservatorium van Amsterdam Symfonieorkest o.l.v. Ed Spanjaard. He also was chosen to represent the Amsterdam Conservatory in a performance with the students from Moscow’s Gnessin Special School of Music in the Jan Pieterzoon Sweelinck Zaal of the Amsterdam Conservatory. Shane became a finalist in the Ile- de-France International Piano Competition shortly thereafter. In addition to competitions and awards, Shane received a 10 (the highest possible score) for his first year bachelor transition exam.  In addition to studying with his own teacher in Amsterdam, Shane has had lessons in the past two years at multiple music festivals: 9de Internationaal Euregio Rijn-Waal Studentenmuziekfestival, studying with Georg Schenck; Schiermonnikoog Jong Talent Festival, in the Netherlands, studying with Jan Wijn; and a public masterclass at the CvA with renowned Italian pianist, Enrico Pace. Shane has also given concerts throughout the Netherlands, Germany, and France. Most recently he appeared on national Dutch television to play a work of one of his favorite composers, Nikolai Medtner. Right before the outbreak of Covid-19, Shane gave a concert in one of the Netherlands most distinguished halls, Muziekgebouw aan ’t IJ, in an all-Beethoven program. Shane also just received a grand piano for his Amsterdam apartment from the National Instrument Funds of the Netherlands. <br>
